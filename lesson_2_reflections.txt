What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	git's tracking system is put in please, in the folder.
	this sets up a git repository allowing to track versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area allows you a spece to collect the files that you specifically wish to commit to the repository. You chose what to add, by 
	doing so you shape and organise the commits so that they make logical sense in relation to your development through time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	By only 'git add' each time you make a single logical change. By only using the command on the files that you know are relevant to the commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	When experimenting.
	When making a permanant split in the solution. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	They bring clarity in terms of the various branches that are in play and the sequence of commits per branch.
	Therefore which items of development are wrapped into the current branch and wheich would need resolved if needing to be 
	absorbed into a master(e.g). The diagrams also show unaccessable commits that may have been created as a variant but not formalised as a branch.
