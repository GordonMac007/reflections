When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When collaborating with other developers.
	When working from different environments.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	So that you can work independantly on an area of development, keep that sand-boxed from the remote repository, possibly as your 'master' and avoid version control complexity that would arise if you constantly downloading the central 'master'.
